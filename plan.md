# 1. Executive Summary

**Society is Vietnam's first technology platform for companion rental services** — a fragmented $10-30 million market with zero digital competitors. We connect clients who need companions for family events, weddings, and business functions with verified companions seeking flexible, high-paying work.

## The Opportunity

Vietnam's companion rental market operates entirely through fragmented channels: detective agencies, PG companies, and private social media groups. Despite proven demand — leading providers report processing over 2 million contracts — no technology platform exists to consolidate this market.

- **Market Size:** $10-30 million annually, growing with urbanization
- **Competition:** Zero technology platforms — entirely offline/fragmented
- **Demand Driver:** 65%+ of Vietnamese women over 28 face constant family pressure about marriage
- **Supply Ready:** 92% of companions are university students earning 1.5-2x average salary

## Our Solution

| For Clients | For Companions |
|-------------|----------------|
| • Verified, trustworthy companions | • Guaranteed payment (no stiffing) |
| • Transparent pricing | • Safety features & GPS tracking |
| • Secure payment via escrow | • Build reputation via reviews |
| • Easy booking system | • More bookings than word-of-mouth |

## Business Model

- **Primary Revenue:** 18% commission on all bookings
- **Secondary Revenue:** Profile boosts, priority placement, verified badges
- **Unit Economics:** LTV $600 / CAC $10 = 60:1 ratio

## Traction & Readiness

- **Technology:** Platform 100% built ($180K development value)
- **Timeline:** Launch-ready for Tet 2026 (peak season)
- **Startup Cost:** Only $6,400 needed vs $300K+ for competitors

- **Average Booking Value:** 1.5-3 million VND ($60-120) per engagement
- **Service Providers:** 10-15 major agencies, thousands of individual providers
- **Geographic Split:** 60% HCMC, 35% Hanoi, 5% other cities

## 2.2 Pricing Structure

**Holiday surcharges:** 60-100% during Tet and Valentine's Day. Last-minute bookings (<24h) command 30% premium.

## 2.3 Demand Side: Who Hires Companions

### Primary Cultural Driver: Family Pressure

The demand for companion rental is driven by Vietnamese cultural dynamics:

- **65%+ of Vietnamese women aged 28+** regularly face family pressure about marriage
- **70%+ of Vietnamese over age 15** are already married, creating intense expectations
- **32% of Vietnamese aged 25-35** have considered using companion rental services
- **"Thể diện" (saving face)** makes appearing single at family gatherings deeply embarrassing

### Use Cases by Frequency

| Use Case | % of Requests | Seasonality |
|----------|---------------|-------------|
| Family introductions / meeting parents | ~50% | Tet peak (3x) |
| Wedding attendance as couple | ~25% | Oct-Dec peak |
| Holiday companionship (Tet, Valentine's) | ~15% | Highly seasonal |
| Business events / client entertainment | ~7% | Year-round |
| Class reunions / social gatherings | ~3% | Year-round |

### Client Pain Points (Current Market)

- **Trust Issues:** No verification; documented cases of companions disappearing mid-service
- **Price Opacity:** Hidden costs, inconsistent pricing across providers
- **Discovery Friction:** Must search through scattered Facebook/Zalo groups
- **Quality Uncertainty:** No reviews, no track record, relying on provider claims

## 2.4 Supply Side: Who Works as Companions

Research reveals that **92% of companions are university students**, attracted by earnings substantially above typical part-time options.

### Earnings Comparison

| Income Source | Monthly Earnings (VND) |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Vietnam average monthly salary | 8.3 million ($321) |
| Standard PG work | 6-9 million ($240-360) |
| **Active companion work** | **10-15 million ($400-600)** |
| Premium companion (peak season) | 15-25 million ($600-1,000) |

**Key Insight:** Companion work pays **1.5-2x the average Vietnamese salary** while offering schedule flexibility — highly attractive to the target supply demographic.

## 2.5 Competitive Landscape

### Critical Finding: Zero Technology Competitors

**No dedicated mobile app or platform exists for companion rental in Vietnam** — a striking gap compared to Japan's Rent-Kano industry or China's "Hire Me Plz" app ecosystem.

**Current Market Channels:**

- **Detective Agencies:** Most professionalized (Thám tử Nhân Duyên, Thám tử Phúc Tâm) — formal contracts but require in-person visits
- **PG/Event Staffing Agencies:** NCA Truyền Thông, PG Á Đông — professional but not purpose-built for companion services
- **Social Media (Informal):** Facebook groups (20,000+ members), Zalo groups — lowest prices but highest risk

### Legal Status

Companion rental exists in a legally permissible but unregulated space. "Under Vietnamese civil and commercial law, there is no regulation whatsoever about companion rental services." Services are treated as civil transactions under Article 513 of the Civil Code 2015. Companies like Vinamost have received official business licenses.

## 2.6 International Comparison

- **Japan (Mature):** Rent-Kano platform with 100,000+ users, 12,000-15,000 yen ($84-105) per 2 hours
- **China (Explosive Growth):** "Hire Me Plz" app → 700,000 users, analysts predict "multi-billion dollar market"
- **Vietnam (Untapped):** Similar cultural drivers (Tet, saving face), mature digital infrastructure — $50-100M potential by 2030

## 2.7 Key Market Conclusions

- **Proven Demand:** 2+ million contracts through single provider, 32% consideration rate
- **Zero Competition:** No technology platform — unprecedented first-mover opportunity
- **Ready Supply:** PG industry provides trained talent earning 1.5-2x average salary
- **Infrastructure Mature:** 50M e-wallets, 75M Zalo users, robust digital payments
